#  Image Classification with CNN

This project demonstrates how to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

##  Dataset

- **CIFAR-10**: Contains 60,000 images across 10 categories:
  - `airplane`, `automobile`, `bird`, `cat`, `deer`, `dog`, `frog`, `horse`, `ship`, `truck`
- Split: 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow 
- Matplotlib

##  Features

- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Custom CNN model using:
  - `Conv2D` layers
  - `MaxPooling2D`
  - `Dense` layers
- Trained on CIFAR-10 dataset
- Accuracy and loss visualization

##  Results

- Final model accuracy printed after evaluation
- Visualization of training vs. validation accuracy over epochs

##  Output

- Trained CNN model
- Test set evaluation
- Accuracy plot
